# HL7v2-FHIR

FHIR converter is a Java based library that enables converting [Hl7v2](https://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_section.cfm?section=13) messages to [FHIR](https://hl7.org/FHIR/) resources.<br>
FHIR converter utilized the open source  [HAPI Library](https://hapifhir.github.io/hapi-hl7v2/) for parsing Hl7 messages and it also utilizes the [HAPI library for FHIR](https://hapifhir.io/) resources to validate the generated FHIR resources.



## Features and Concepts
HL7v2-FHIR converter converts a given HL7 message to FHIR bundle resource using the message templates. These templates are [yaml](https://yaml.org/) files. Each message template defines what all FHIR resources needs to be generated from a particular message. <br>

### Structure of a message template
A message template file consists of list of resources that can be generated from that message type.
For each resource in a template following attributes needs to be defined:
```yml
      resourceName: [REQUIRED]
      segment: [REQUIRED]
      resourcePath: [REQUIRED] 
      order:[DEFAULT 0] 
      repeates:  [DEFAULT false]       
      additionalSegments: [DEFAULT empty] 
```
Attribute description: 
* resourceName:  Name of the resource example: Patient
* segment: Primary segment that this resource depends on. Example patient resource depends on PID segment
* resourcePath: Path for resource file example: Patient resource :src/main/resources/resource/Patient.yml
* order: Order of resource generation, example -- generate Patient resource followed by Encounter and so on.
* repeates:  HL7 have certain segments that repeat and so the convertor needs to generate multiple resources from those segments. Example OBX segment. If this field is set to false then only the first occurance of that segment will be used for resource generation. If this is set to true then multiple resources will be generated from each of the occurrences of that segment.  
* additionalSegments: Any additional segments the resource needs.



In order to convert the message the converter executes following steps:
* Detect the HL7 message type
* Based on the message type select the HL7 message template
